This document describes the LCSS project of team 07. For our Lab project in the module Large and Cloud-based Software Systems we want to create a coupon application where a user can upload a coupon code and other users can up or down vote the coupon code, can comment and can search through hashtags. We primarily want to find out what impact in terms of performance different methods of getting data from a database and search through the results can have.
